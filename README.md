A District-based corruption reporting system for Bangladesh that enables citizens to report corruption incidents anonymously while providing **real-time data visualization, filtering, and AI-powered summaries**.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Bangladesh faces severe corruption challenges, with TIB’s 2023 survey revealing 70% households experienced corruption, costing 10,902 crore taka in bribes. Health, local government, and education sectors are most affected. Yet, 60% citizens lack a centralized reporting system and fear retaliation, leaving corruption largely unreported.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Transparency Tracker is a digital platform designed to simplify district-based corruption reporting in Bangladesh. It allows users to submit anonymous reports across eight categories while ensuring full confidentiality. The system provides real-time data visualization, highlighting trends and patterns to help authorities identify corruption hotspots. Users receive instant notifications about the status of their reports, enhancing transparency and trust. By combining intuitive dashboards with analytical tools, the platform makes complex data easy to understand and actionable. Its unique features—anonymous reporting, real-time tracking, and visual analytics—address the lack of centralized reporting systems, reduce fear of retaliation, and empower citizens to actively participate in combating corruption effectively.
